# Unicode (Universal Character Set) is a set of characters that comprises of formulas, symbols, and text of various languages
# There are multiple unicode encoding schemes to represent characters in 7, 8, 16, or 32 bits

# Another set of characters is ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) which does not encompass as wide a range of characters as Unicode
# The ASCII encoding schemes only represent characters in 7 or 8 bits and as such, ASCII is a subset of Unicode

# Unicode is used more often for encoding and representing characters in software
# ASCII is used for electronic communication and programming languages like HTML

# A string is an array of unicode characters
# As such, many array operations can also be applied to strings, but there are some that behave differently depending on the language
	# The "==" operator may or may not do a proper comparison of whether two strings are the same in composition
	# Strings are immutable in some languages, meaning that they cannot be changed (i.e. changing the character at an index)
